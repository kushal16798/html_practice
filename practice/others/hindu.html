Jyotiraditya Scindia met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, rising speculations that he might join BJP. 
Congress has expelled disgruntled party leader from Madhya Pradesh Jyotiraditya Scindia for "anti-party activities". Meanwhile, Mr. Scindia said he has resigned from the primary membership of Congress.
Congress president has approved the expulsion of Sh. Jyotiraditya Scindia from the Indian National Congress with immediate effect for anti-party activities, party's general secretary K.C. Venugopal said.
The resignation letter of Mr. Scindia, dated March 9, 2020 and addressed to party president Sonia Gandhi, stated "this was a path that has been drawing itself out over the last year."</p>

The meetings will be held in Bhopal.

<p id="id2"><strong>BJP had arranged chartered planes to move Cong MLAs to Bengaluru:</strong> Digvijaya
Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Tuesday parried questions on the exact number of MLAs supporting the party in Madhya Pradesh amid a political crisis triggered by the resignation of Jyotiraditya Scindia and 14 MLAs loyal to him.

Repeating his allegation that the BJP was trying to destabilise the Congress-led government, Mr. Singh told reporters that the BJP had arranged three chartered planes for Bengaluru on Monday to fly out some MLAs loyal to Mr. Scindia.</p>

<p id="id2"><strong>The number game</strong><br>The strength of Madhya Pradesh Assembly is 230, with the halfway mark being 116. The BJP has 107 MLAs. There are four Independent MLAs, two BSP members and a lone SP MLA.

In the 2018 State elections, Congress won 114 seats, one seat short of halfway mark. Congress leader Kamal Nath became the Chief Minister with the support of BSP, SP and the Independents.

As many as 21 members have resigned to day.

The party's strength will be reduced to 94 if the resignations are accepted.</p><hr>
<p id="id2"><strong>Another MLA resigns</strong></p>
<img src="5.png" id="pic1">
<p id="id2">Another Congress MLA Aidal Singh Kansana has sent his resignation to the Speaker.  With this 21 MLAs have submitted their resignations.

This includes ministers Tulsi Silawat, Govind Singh Rajput, Dr Prabhuram Choudhry, Imarti Devi, Pradyumna Singh Tomar and Mahendra Singh Sisodia.

Other MLAs who have resigned: Hardeep Singh Dang, Rajyavardhan Singh, Brajendra Singh Yadav, Jaspal Jajji, Suresh Dhakad, Jaswant Jatav, Santram Sironia, Munnalal Goyal, Ranveer Singh Jatav, OPS Bhadoria, Kamlesh Jatav, Giriraj Dandotiya, Raghuraj Kansana, and Biasahulal Singh.</p><hr>
<p id="id2"><strong>Rajya Sabha election, not wresting power, is our priority:</strong> Chouhan
With 19 MLAs supporting Jyotiraditya Scindia tendering their resignations, and Mr. Scindia joining the BJP becoming more evident, all eyes are on former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.

The speculation of Mr. Chouhan staking claim to form the government gained louder after BSP MLA Sanjeev Kushwah and SP MLA Rajesh Shukla, who back the Kamal Nath government, arrived at the BJP vice-president's residence. But Mr. Chouhan played it down saying they had come to wish him for Holi. "They are like my younger brothers, and we meet every year," he added.

Our priority is not to form a government in Madhya Pradesh, but gather numbers for the forthcoming  Rajya Sabha election, Mr. Chouhan said.</p>
